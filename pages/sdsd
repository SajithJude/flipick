                    <sub_Topic_Contents>Now-a-days, banking services are not a luxury but a necessity of life for everyone. The financial needs of the excluded are varied and distinct. They need access to banking services for their day-to-day activities.</sub_Topic_Contents >

            <Contents>Savings, insurance and most importantly credit. In equal measure, they also need counselling as to how to access and use financial services. Given the poor economic status of the excluded, it is evident that the individual credit requirement could be small and initial demand for remittance and other facilities offered by the banks may not be much. also, these accounts may not have regular and high turnover. typically, this is low volume, low turnover and high number market. Needless to say, however, that these people must be given access to formal financial services so that the overall development goals can be achieved. however, it was felt that the branch banking and electronic banking may not be appropriate models to reach the excluded people as financial inclusion involves financial education, counselling and building up of close relationship with people. In this background and in order to take banking services to the people living in unbanked and under banked areas, the Business Facilitator/Business Correspondent (BF/BC) Model was introduced.</Contents>

But unlike commercial banks, their area of operations was restricted to a few districts. also, they do not offer all the financial services that are offered by commercial banks. their ownership/capital is provided jointly by Central Government (50%), concerned State Government (15%) and the sponsoring bank (35%). In order to ensure better viability of these rrBs, sponsor banks have started merging their rrBs at State level. after the merger, the number has been reduced from 196 to 56 as on 31st March, 2017.</sub_Topic_Contents>

                    <sub_Topic_Contents>Traditional Functions: Acceptance of Deposits - a bank accepts money from its customers (members of the public). A customer can keep his/her monies in current accounts where no interest is payable or in savings accounts (also known as savings deposit accounts) where nominal interest is paid. Normally, business firms/companies open current accounts which facilitate large number of transactions. In the case of individuals, and where commercial transactions may not be involved, savings accounts are opened. In both these cases, the amount deposited is repayable back to the customer as and when demanded/needed. Because of this aspect, current accounts and savings accounts are also known as demand deposits and customers can withdraw the funds by issuing cheques. Savings account holders are issued ATM cards by using which they can withdraw cash in the ATMs. The accounts, where the customers/savers can keep their funds for a longer time are called term deposits. Term deposits could be in the form of fixed deposits, recurring/cumulative deposits, monthly income deposits, etc. Unlike current and savings bank deposits, wherein the amount deposited with the banks are repayable on demand, in the case of term deposits, the amounts deposited are, normally, repayable only after the expiry of the agreed term/period for which it is kept. There are, however, provisions for closing the deposit account prematurely and withdrawing the amount subject to certain penal interest stipulations. Term deposits constitute the largest portion of a bank’s funds.</sub_Topic_Contents>

            <Contents>(b) Loans and Advances

Banks have to pay interest on the deposits at agreed rates of interest. In ad-dition, they have to meet their operational expenses. therefore, banks have to invest/lend the monies and earn interest. Lending money by way of loans and advances of various kinds is thus an important traditional function of a bank. the funds mobilized, in the form of deposits, and monies borrowed are deployed by a bank as loans and advances to earn profits by way of interest spreads, i.e. the differential between the average interest rates on loans and on deposits. the interest income from loans and advances forms a major source of a bank’s operating profit. 

Banks lend in the form of Cash Credits, Overdrafts, Demand Loans and term Loans. Based on the borrower profile, loans can be classified as Corporate Loans, SMe advances, agricultural Loans, retail Loans, Foreign Currency Loans, educational Loans, Vehicle Loans etc. Loans are also classified on the basis of security. Security could be in the form of surety, pledge of Bank’s Deposit receipts, shares and debentures, assignment of Life Insurance policies, Mortgage of immovable property, hypothecation of plant and machinery, raw material etc. a loan account with security is known as secured loan whereas a loan without security is known as clean loan (clean advance). 

In order to repay depositors on demand and pay interest on borrowed funds and deposits, banks expect that all the borrowers who take the loans are prompt in payment of interest and repayment of principal amount. however, it is possible that on account a number of reasons, the interest and principal may get defaulted and become overdue. Loans and advances which remain overdue for more than a stipulated period is known as ‘non-performing assets’ (Npas). Npas cause loss of income (interest not being paid or recovered) and in some cases loss of the principal (amount lent). Lending, therefore, calls for good credit appraisal and requires adequate care, caution and supervision/monitoring by the bank to prevent loans turning overdue and eventually into Npas. Collection or recovery of dues/overdues is important for sustaining the viability of banks.</Contents>

travel from one place to another for making payments. Nor will it be con-
venient to carry large sums of money from one place to another place. It is, 
therefore, necessary that a good payment and settlement system should exist 
for enabling trade and commerce in the country. Banks perform the job of 
payment and settlements in the financial market. In this regard, Banks have 
branch network spread across various cities/regions/states. Some banks have 
branches and correspondent banks overseas as well. this network enables the 
banks to remit funds of their customers, if needed, from one place to another 
in the same country or overseas by mail/telegraphic/electronic funds transfer 
or by issuing bank drafts. Banks charge appropriate fee from the remitting 
person for the service rendered. remittance of funds by banks is fast, safe, 
secure and cheap as compared to other modes of funds transfer, like post 
office money order (which is generally for small sums of money for personal 
use), physical transfer of money etc.</Contents>

Information technology has, thus brought ‘any where and any time banking’ and contributed to the speed, accuracy and confidentiality of customers’ transactions while enhancing customers’ convenience resulting in customer delight. the funds transfer and cheques clearing and collection of bills of exchange are also done electronically with accuracy, speed and safety. Internal house-keeping is done accurately and much faster. these new banking channels have ensured that the customer need not necessarily go to the branches for cash withdrawal, deposit of cheques, obtaining account statement etc., but has access to other channels such as atM, Credit/Debit Card or internet.</Contents>

                            <sub_Topic_Contents>Financial Inclusion implies bringing low income and disadvantaged groups under the coverage of banking by providing them access to banking services at affordable cost. Introduction of pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (pMJ-DY), pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Scheme, pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana are aiming to provide financial products to all such people who have been excluded so far. Using services of Business Correspondents and Business Facilitators for providing banking services in the remotest areas have been a success attempt in this regard. Setting up of new payment Banks and Small Finance Banks would boost financial inclusion to a great extent. the entry of a substantial number of new, differentiated banks is an overarching growth driver for the financial distribution segment. the other three growth drivers for the segment include providing an impetus to change in the delivery and consumption of financial services, demographic factors, technology changes and regulation. as non-banking digital companies and new banks, premised on low cost-high tech models to deal with low value-high volume customers, make their mark in the banking universe, the delivery of financial services must be reimagined by the supply side.</sub_Topic_Contents>
