    <Topic>  1.1 Need of a Bank </Topic>
        <Topic_Contents>Indian Banking System for the last two centuries has seen many developments. Till 1955, the commercial banking was in the hands of private corporates. Setting up of State Bank of India and its subsidiaries and, thereafter nationalization of banks changed the structure of banks. With the start of financial reforms in 1991-92, new private banks came into existence and the full use of technology by these banks improved customer service in banks to a great extent. Today, all banks are competing with each other in regard to the development of new products matching with global standards. Banks offer savings, remittance, credit and other ancillary products to their customers. In addition, customers are also offered insurance and other risk management products. There are a large number of commercial bank branches and cooperative societies which are offering banking services to the people of India.</Topic_Contents>

    <sub_Topic_Contents>Traditional Functions: Acceptance of Deposits, Advances, Remittance Facilities, Agency Services and Other Services.</sub_Topic_Contents>
    <sub_Topic_name>   (a) Acceptance of Deposits </sub_Topic_name>
    <sub_Topic_name_Contents>A bank accepts money from its customers (members of the public). A customer can keep his/her monies in current accounts where no interest is payable or in savings accounts (also known as savings deposit accounts) where nominal interest is paid. Normally, business firms/companies open current accounts which facilitate large number of transactions. In the case of individuals, and where commercial transactions may not be involved, savings accounts are opened. In both these cases, the amount deposited is repayable back to the customer as and when demanded/needed. Because of this aspect, current accounts and savings accounts are also known as demand deposits and customers can withdraw the funds by issuing cheques. Savings account holders are issued ATM cards by using which they can withdraw cash in the ATMs. The accounts, where the customers/savers can keep their funds for a longer time are called term deposits. Term deposits could be in the form of fixed deposits, recurring/cumulative deposits, monthly income deposits, etc. Unlike current and savings bank deposits, wherein the amount deposited with the banks are repayable on demand, in the case of term deposits, the amounts deposited are normally repayable only after the expiry of the agreed term/period for which it is kept. There are however provisions for closing the deposit account prematurely and withdrawing the amount subject to certain penal interest stipulations. Term deposits constitute the largest portion of a bank’s funds.</sub_Topic_name_Contents>

            Banks have to pay interest on the deposits at agreed rates of interest. In addition, they have to meet their operational expenses. Therefore, banks have to invest/lend the monies and earn interest. Lending money by way of loans and advances of various kinds is thus an important traditional function of a bank. The funds mobilized, in the form of deposits, and monies borrowed are deployed by a bank as loans and advances to earn profits by way of interest spreads, i.e. the differential between the average interest rates on loans and on deposits. The interest income from loans and advances forms a major source of a bank’s operating profit. 
        </Topic_Contents>
    <sub_Topic>  1.1 Loans and Advances  </sub_Topic>
        <sub_Topic_Contents> 
            Banks lend in the form of Cash Credits, Overdrafts, Demand Loans and term Loans. Based on the borrower profile, loans can be classified as Corporate Loans, SME advances, agricultural Loans, retail Loans, Foreign Currency Loans, educational Loans, Vehicle Loans etc. Loans are also classified on the basis of security. Security could be in the form of surety, pledge of Bank’s Deposit receipts, shares and debentures, assignment of Life Insurance policies, Mortgage of immovable property, hypothecation of plant and machinery, raw material etc. A loan account with security is known as secured loan whereas a loan without security is known as clean loan (clean advance). 
In order to repay depositors on demand and pay interest on borrowed funds and deposits, banks expect that all the borrowers who take the loans are prompt in payment of interest and repayment of principal amount. However, it is possible that on account a number of reasons, the interest and principal may get defaulted and become overdue. Loans and advances which remain overdue for more than a stipulated period is known as ‘non-performing assets’ (NPAs). NPAs cause loss of income (interest not being paid or recovered) and in some cases loss of the principal (amount lent). Lending, therefore, calls for good credit appraisal and requires adequate care, caution and supervision/monitoring by the bank to prevent loans turning overdue and eventually into NPAs. Collection or recovery of dues/overdues is important for sustaining the viability of banks.</sub_Topic_Contents>

Nor will it be convenient to carry large sums of money from one place to another place. It is, therefore, necessary that a good payment and settlement system should exist for enabling trade and commerce in the country. Banks perform the job of payment and settlements in the financial market. In this regard, Banks have branch network spread across various cities/regions/states. Some banks have branches and correspondent banks overseas as well. this network enables the banks to remit funds of their customers, if needed, from one place to another in the same country or overseas by mail/telegraphic/electronic funds transfer or by issuing bank drafts. Banks charge appropriate fee from the remitting person for the service rendered. remittance of funds by banks is fast, safe, secure and cheap as compared to other modes of funds transfer, like post office money order (which is generally for small sums of money for personal use), physical transfer of money etc. </Topic_Contents>

      Banking in India has been through many changes over the years. Banks have moved from traditional banking to fee-based services, increased thrust on financial inclusion, and increased use of technology. Some popular fee-based services in India include investment banking activities, advisory services, wealth management, selling insurance and mutual fund products. 
  </Topic_Contents>
  <sub_Topic>    1.1 Increased Thrust on Financial Inclusion    </sub_Topic>
  <sub_Topic_Contents>   Financial Inclusion implies bringing low income and disadvantaged groups under the coverage of banking by providing them access to banking services at affordable cost. Introduction of pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (pMJ-DY), pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Scheme, pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana are aiming to provide financial products to all such people who have been excluded so far. Using services of Business Correspondents and Business Facilitators for providing banking services in the remotest areas have been a success attempt in this regard. Setting up of new payment Banks and Small Finance Banks would boost financial inclusion to a great extent. The entry of a substantial number of new, differentiated banks is an overarching growth driver for the financial distribution segment. The other three growth drivers for the segment include providing an impetus to change in the delivery and consumption of financial services, demographic factors, technology changes and regulation. As non-banking digital companies and new banks, premised on low cost-high tech models to deal with low value-high volume customers, make their mark in the banking universe, the delivery of financial services must be reimagined by the supply side.  </sub_Topic_Contents>
  <sub_Topic_name>   (a) Increased Use of Technology: </sub_Topic_name>
  <sub_Topic_name_Contents>   Adoption of new technology in banks has considerably changed the banking culture itself. Technological evolution increased automation of banking operations which enabled off-site banking through ATMs, internet banking, payment of utilities through banks, travel reservation through banks, etc. Core Banking Solution (CBS) implemented in almost all banks has enabled anywhere, anytime banking. Use of mobile banking is increasing day-by-day. Remittances of funds through RTGS and NEFT have facilitated the individuals and also the traders. Banks are also entering into the “wallet” banking business for penetrating its outreach to the vast population of the country. Use of plastic money like credit cards, debit cards and other pre-paid instruments at the “point of sale” are becoming popular.  </sub_Topic_name_Contents>

                    The banking industry in India has witnessed mergers and acquisitions triggered by a combination of Government dictate and synergistic motives. A higher capital base, which could be possible through consolidation, will thus allow higher lending to borrowers. Other perceived benefits from Consolidation are increased efficiency and profitability. It is expected that the Indian Banking sector will witness consolidation through M&A to meet challenges and exploit synergistic benefits.
